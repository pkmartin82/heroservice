# Run the following commands:

brew update
brew install mariadb

# 2/4/18 - Even though mysql/mariadb "could not be found" prior to running this command, after running this command
# the mysql/mariadb instance "remembered" the pkm database and the Hero/Alliance tables, with rows inserted to them 
# back in 2015.

# From there, to start the mysql service, run:

mysqlstart # see .alias file

# Then enter mysql by running:

mysql # see .alias file
